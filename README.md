## Introduction 
Audius is a music streaming platform that aims to create a unity-based, decentralized community of artists, content creators and listeners. Although similar to Soundcloud, Audius has found out a way to work around certain restrictions and let artists upload their music freely. Audius is also “the only music streaming platform built on a new technology paradigm - Ethereum - which has unprecedented built-in financial tools,” meaning artists will get paid more than they would if they were a part of a label or a different streaming platform. Open to the public since 2019, the platform has gained traction in getting various well-known artists to join their project and continues to expand.

The purpose of Usability Testing is to see what users would struggle with during their experience with a sotfware, product, or service. We want to get feedback in order to improve users experience. The purpose of this usability test is to learn how to improve music lovers' experience with music streaming apps. Once we find issues that are challenging for users, we can turn these issues into factors that make an app satisfactory, effective, and efficient.

## Reflection 
One thing I learned from the Usability Test that stood out to me the most was that, even if the interface design looks simple and easy to use, that isn't the case. I thought that the more simple or minimalistic an app is, the easier it would be to use and realized I was really wrong about that. My participant helped me realize that there needs to be more cues and information provided to the users so that users feel more confident and in control when navigating the app. Other than that, I discovered small issues that should be fixed because overtime these issues can get really frustrating and hard to deal with. 

As a moderator, I found myself wanting to input my own opinions and sometimes caught myself expressing more emotion than I should. To improve, I would like to work on keeping a neutral facial expression because I realize how that could affect the participants. I also felt like I was in a rush and started to feel a bit impatient but realized that this is productive because we want to see what users have difficulty with or that they're taking more time than they expected, which in turn tells us what we can work on. Also, I could work on my encouragement because I felt like I was just acknowledging their input but could be more vocal about my praise and appreciation.
